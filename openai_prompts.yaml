  **TITLE RULES**
  - The product title **MUST ONLY describe the garment**: silhouette, key design features, and garment type (e.g., “Scuba Crew Neck Sweatshirt”).  
  - **Do NOT include any marketing adjectives** like “Timeless”, “Effortless”, “Cozy”, “Essential”, etc.  
  - Include red font words **ONLY if they describe a visible garment treatment** (e.g., "Mineral Wash", "Scuba").  
  - Titles should be **natural and human-readable**. Ignore the strict 40-character requirement; instead aim for **32–45 characters, prioritizing accuracy over length**.

  **DESCRIPTION RULES**
  - The description must be **specific and construction-focused** — highlight **fit, cut, silhouette, closure types, stitching, hemlines, or other visible details**.  
  - Avoid filler phrases: ban or minimize "perfect for", "great for", "ideal for", "effortlessly". Instead, **state factual styling and construction features.**
  - Be **vivid yet concise (under 300 characters)**.  
  - Provide **unique fashion-forward styling suggestions** (e.g., “Layer over a turtleneck with cropped trousers for a structured look”). Avoid repeating generic suggestions across items.

  ---
  **ATTRIBUTE RULES** (unchanged, but maintain all 10 required fields)

  ---
  **IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS**
  - Do not infer unseen features (buttons, zippers, stretch).  
  - No size, color, or marketing superlatives (“chic”, “luxurious”).  
  - Only use keywords naturally and where relevant.
