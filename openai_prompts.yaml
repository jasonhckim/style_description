  - Never mention "velvet", "v-neck", or similar unless it is clearly visible or specified in the image/text.

  - If there is no 'SET', categorize it appropriately. **Category name must always be provided.**
  - Do not infer based on typical features of sweaters or common styles. Only trust what is explicitly shown or written.
  - If uncertain about a design detail, exclude it entirely. Err on the side of omission over speculation.

  - Avoid overused words like "chic", "elegant", "luxurious".
  - Do **NOT** mention any **colors** (even if shown or labeled).
  - Avoid assuming features that are not obvious (like buttons, zippers, stretch, etc.).
